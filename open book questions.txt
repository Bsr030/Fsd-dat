Q1.Build Search filter in React
React code to build a simple search filter functionality to display a filtered list based on the search query entered
by the user.
The following are the steps to create a Search filter using React JS:
1. Declare React states for search input values.
2. Create HTML input text for entering search term and update state in onChange function.
3. Add Array.filter() on list of items with search term value.
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import SearchFilter from './SearchFilter';
const App = () => {
return (
<div>
<h1>Search Filter Example</h1>
<SearchFilter />
</div>);};
export default App;
// index.js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
ReactDOM.render(
<React.StrictMode>
<App />
</React.StrictMode>,
document.getElementById('root')
);
//SearchFilter.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
const SearchFilter = () => {
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
const [data, setData] = useState([
'Apple',
'Banana',
'Cherry',
'Date',
'Grapes',
'Lemon',
'Orange',
'Peach',
]);
const handleSearch = (event) => {
setSearchTerm(event.target.value);
};
const filteredData = data.filter((item) =>
item.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase()));
return (
<div>
<h1>Search Filter in React</h1>
<input
type="text"
placeholder="Search..."
value={searchTerm}
onChange={handleSearch}/>
<ul>
{filteredData.map((item, index) => (
<li key={index}>{item}</li>
))}
</ul></div>);};
export default SearchFilter;

Q2. Simple Login form in React
React code for simple login form where the user login by entering their username and password. The form inputs
are validated to check if correct information is entered and the error messages are the validation fails. The login
form is hidden and the “Welcome, ${name}” message is shown when the user login is successful.
The following are the steps to create a simple login form using React JS:
1. Create name, email and password input form elements.
2. React States to store user input values.
3. Add form validation for compare name, email and password with correct values.
4. Display “Welcome, ${name}” if login is successful, else display the error message.
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import SearchFilter from './LoginForm';
const App = () => {
return (
<div>
<h1>Search Filter Example</h1>
<SearchFilter />
</div>);};
export default App;
//LoginForm.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
const LoginForm = () => {
const [name, setName] = useState('');
const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
const [loggedIn, setLoggedIn] = useState(false);
const [error, setError] = useState('');
const handleLogin = () => {
const correctName = 'Sivani';
const correctEmail = 'ksisivani04@gmail.com';
const correctPassword = 'password123';
if (name === correctName && email === correctEmail && password === correctPassword) {
setLoggedIn(true);
setError('');
} else {
setLoggedIn(false);
setError('Invalid credentials. Please try again.');}};
return (
<div>
<label>Name:
<input type="text" value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} /></label>
<br />
<label>Email:
<input type="text" value={email} onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)} /></label>
<br />
<label>Password:
<input type="password" value={password} onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)} />
</label>
<br />
<button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button>
{loggedIn ? (
<p>Welcome, {name}!</p>
) : (
<p style={{ color: 'red' }}>{error}</p>
)}
</div>);};
export default LoginForm;
// index.js

const SimpleCounter = () => {
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
const increment = () => {
setCount(count + 1);
};
const decrement = () => {
setCount(count - 1);
};
return (
<div>
<h2>Simple Counter</h2>
<p>Count: {count}</p>
<button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
<button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
</div>
);};
export default SimpleCounter;

Q8: differentiate between SOAP and REST. Which one is being used for APIs and why?
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and REST (Representational State Transfer) are two different architectural styles for
designing web services. Here are the key differences between SOAP and REST:
### SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):
1. **Protocol Type:**
 - SOAP is a protocol, a set of rules for structuring messages that are exchanged between computers.
2. **Message Format:**
 - SOAP messages are XML-based and can be quite verbose, containing a lot of metadata.
 - Typically, SOAP messages are sent over HTTP or SMTP.
3. **Statefulness:**
 - SOAP can be stateful, meaning the server can store information about the client between requests.
4. **Operations:**
 - SOAP supports a wide range of operations, including complex transactions and security.
5. **Standards:**
 - SOAP has a set of formal standards and specifications (WS-Security, WS-Transaction, etc.).
6. **Flexibility:**
 - Due to its complexity and standards, SOAP is often considered more rigid and less flexible than REST.
### REST (Representational State Transfer):
1. **Architectural Style:**
 - REST is an architectural style that uses a stateless, client-server communication model.
2. **Message Format:**
 - RESTful APIs use lightweight data formats such as JSON for data exchange.
 - Data is often represented in a resource-oriented way.
3. **Statelessness:**
 - REST is stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all the information needed to understand and fulfill the
request.
4. **Operations:**
 - RESTful APIs are typically limited to a small set of operations (HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
 - It follows the principles of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
5. **Standards:**
 - REST relies on standards like HTTP, URI, and MIME.
6. **Flexibility:**
 - REST is considered more flexible and scalable. It is simpler and easier to use for a wide range of clients.
### Usage for APIs:
REST is more commonly used for modern web APIs for several reasons:
1. **Simplicity:**
 - REST is simpler to implement and understand. It uses standard HTTP methods and is based on the principles of the web.
2. **Flexibility:**
 - REST is more flexible and can be used with different data formats (JSON, XML) and can be easily consumed by a wide
variety of clients, including browsers, mobile devices, and other applications.
3. **Scalability:**
 - Due to its stateless nature and simplicity, RESTful APIs are often more scalable and easier to maintain.
4. **Performance:**
 - JSON, commonly used with REST, is more lightweight than XML, making it faster to parse and transmit.
5. **Industry Adoption:**
 - REST has gained widespread industry adoption, and many modern frameworks and tools are built with RESTful principles
in mind.
While SOAP is still used in certain scenarios, especially in enterprise environments where there may be existing SOAP-based
systems, REST has become the preferred choice for building APIs in the context of modern web development due to its
simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use.


Q9: develop rest API for the bookstore application. API should be created to enable the user to retrieve
the book details update a new book entry and search for an entry based on a book id. Assume bookstore
